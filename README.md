# Neural Jump Ordinary Differential Equations for Classification

This repository is highly inspired by
[Neural Jump Ordinary Differential Equations: Consistent Continuous-Time Prediction and Filtering](https://openreview.net/forum?id=JFKR3WqwyXR),
and its [official implementation](https://github.com/HerreraKrachTeichmann/NJODE).

The above work presents a model (NJ-ODE) for point prediction of time series. We modify this model for the case of classification of time series. For details, see the [presentation](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:a64353d4-3122-458b-a115-96e2d2ea64a3) that was presented for the lecture Machine Learning in Finance, ETH ZÃ¼rich, D-MATH, Stochastic Finance Group.
