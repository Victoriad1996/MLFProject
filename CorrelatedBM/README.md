The stock_models.py and data_utils.py are the modified files with the necessary code to create the correlated paths.

The Add_stock_models.py and Add_data_utils.py contain just the code that should be added to their respective files (for example if you already changed significantly the files).

The 'Create correlated BM.ipynb' should be run in the NJODE/NJODE folder. It gives an example of how to generate the data.
